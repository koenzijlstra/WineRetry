## Purpose
The aim of this application is to profide a product-specific marktplaats/ebay like app for people looking to buy or sell rare or old bottles of wine. FineWine has a realtime-chat function for the communication between the seller of a wine bottle and a user that is interested in (buying) the bottle. User-authentication and database management is done with the use of Firebase.

The BaseActivity class that contains the functions to show and hide an alertdialog is created with the use of code from   https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android
Both the LoginActivity and SignupActivity were partly inspired by the following tutorial:

## UI
Below are some pictures to give an idea of how the user interface will look. The activites Buyfullinfo and Sellfullinfo have a dialog theme.
