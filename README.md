## Purpose
The aim of this application is to profide a product-specific marktplaats/ebay like app for people looking to buy or sell rare or old bottles of wine. FineWine has a realtime-chat function for the communication between the seller of a wine bottle and a user that is interested in (buying) the bottle. User-authentication and database management is done with the use of Firebase.

### Copyright and references

Both iconsdb.com and freeiconspng.com specifically state that the icons that were used can be used freely in both personal and commercial projects with no attribution required. They do however mention that an attribition is always appreciated, which is why they are mentioned here.
